    abstract = { The flight control system proposed for future Boeing commercial airplanes is a Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system. The entirely electronic FBW system will replace the mechanical cable/quadrant/pushrod system used on earlier airplanes. The FB W system, also called an Electronic Flight Control System (EFCS), must meet extremely high standards of integrity and reliabil ity. The heart of the FBW concept is the use of redundant, dissimilar computing and communication channels.Predicting the performance of such a system is beyond the capabilities of conventional simulation and control system design methods. Moreover, the number of independent, random parameters in the system makes straight forward Monte Carlo analysis prohibitively expensive. This paper describes the simulation methods used to model the EFCS, and the use of statistically designed experiments to extract more infor mation about the performance of the EFCS with a smaller number of simulation runs than is possible with a less structured approach. The results of the analysis defined the performance of the EFCS, especially the tails of the distribu tions of the performance measures, with much greater confidence than could have been gained by more conventional methods. }

abstract = {Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. Microservice technologies are moving quickly. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts while diving into current solutions for modeling, integrating, testing, deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. You'll follow a fictional company throughout the book to learn how building a microservice architecture affects a single domain.}

  abstract={By leveraging the progress of information technology and computer networks, Real Time Gross Settlement systems (RTGS), which first appeared in the early 1990s, have quickly become the standard for the settlement of interbank payments in central bank money. However, the market of retail payments still relies on batch-based netting systems, as the huge volume of retail payments makes the architecture of a typical RTGS impractical in this context. The Eurosystemâ€™s decision to provide a settlement service for instant payments has laid the foundation for the transformation of retail systems into real-time systems. A new design for settlement engines is needed, which should now be capable of settling an extremely high volume of payments in real time, while also operating continuously and exposing low transaction costs. This need has been the main driver for the design of the TIPS (Target Instant Payment Settlement) engine, a distributed, event-driven architecture based on principles of reactive applications and running on Linux/x86 commodity systems for cost efficiency. This paper shows how the traditional design of a mostly centralized, vertically scalable RTGS can be replaced by a distributed, horizontally scalable system, provided that the proper mix of parallel and sequential computation is used.},
